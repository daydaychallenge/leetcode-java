 * 73. Set Matrix Zeroes
 * Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0,
 * set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix.
 *
 * You must do it in place.
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
 * A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
 * Could you devise a constant space solution?
